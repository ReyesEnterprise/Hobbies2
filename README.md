Hello World! and thank you for visiting my website it really means a lot to me. I have been working very hard on this Hobbies website trying to master my skills like HTML, CSS, FelexBox, and Grid just to name a few. I really learned a lot
But I am always open to some Feedback as we are always learning and working toward a better tomorrow again I thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy viewing my site as much as I enjoyed making it.

//** some things to keep in mind **//

1: This site is not a professional website.

2: This website is better on a larger screen but was made
adaptable to smaller screens like phones and tablets.

3: This is a website for my final project for a school our assignment was to work with
CSS and HTML primarily so if things like forms don't work properly yet it's mainly intentional.

in conclusion, thank you for your time, and ENJOY!!
