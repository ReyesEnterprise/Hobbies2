            I've been told that the intro to a website is like the welcome mat
            to your home, so I would like to take this time to thank you for
            visiting my website. As the name suggests this website is mainly all
            about my hobbies. Flying My Drone, Playing My Guitar, and Editing My
            family videos are some of my passions. As you scroll through my
            website you will be able to see how my hobbies have impacted my life
            and what they have meant to me. I also do hope you can enjoy the
            layout, color, and flow of my website as it did take a while to
            master a lot of these skills like Flexbox and Grid, while some I
            already knew about it was a fun and enjoyable journey to create this
            pleasantly appealing website. I would like to thank you for your
            time and I am always open to any feedback in the more section.
            please be kind as it is my first official website. Thank you!

                  growing up I've always been a movie buff I loved how movies
                  unfold and tell a story, how they touch and pull at your
                  emotions. Of course, the next natural step would be to want to
                  make my own movies...right? at least for me, it was I could
                  spend hours on my computer trying to get that perfect clip for
                  my home video.

                  Dones have been a hobby of mine for as long as I can Remember,
                  when I was a child I wanted to be a pilot when I grew up but
                  it always seemed out of reach. Now with drones being more
                  affordable than ever, I can finally get my wings, well at
                  least in a virtual sense.

                  Playing the Guitar is something I always recommend everyone
                  learns to do, It is a skill that always impresses everyone at
                  a campfire but to me, it's more than a cool party trick it's a
                  skill that really lets you express yourself without having to
                  say any words, with every strum and every note it unlocks a
                  new part of your brain that can't be expressed but only felt.
