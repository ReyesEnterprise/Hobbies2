          I've been told that the intro to a website is like the welcome mat to
          your home, so I would like to take this time to thank you for visiting
          my website. As the name suggests this website is mainly all about my
          hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flying My Drone, Playing My Guitar, and Editing My family videos are
          some of my passions. As you scroll through my website you will be able
          to see how my hobbies have impacted my life and what they have meant
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also do hope you can enjoy the layout, color, and flow of my website
          as it did take a while to master a lot of these skills like Flexbox
          and Grid, while some I already knew about it was a fun and enjoyable
          journey to create this pleasantly appealing website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to thank you for your time and I am always open to any
          feedback in the more section. please be kind as it is my first
          official website. Thank you!

          growing up I've always been a movie buff I loved how movies unfold and
          tell a story, how they touch and pull at your emotions. Of course, the
          next natural step would be to want to make my own movies...right? at
          least for me, it was I could spend hours on my computer trying to get
          that perfect clip for my home video.

          Dones have been a hobby of mine for as long as I can Remember, when I
          was a child I wanted to be a pilot when I grew up but it always seemed
          out of reach. Now with drones being more affordable than ever, I can
          finally get my wings, well at least in a virtual sense.

          Playing the Guitar is something I always recommend everyone learns to
          do, It is a skill that always impresses everyone at a campfire but to
          me, it's more than a cool party trick it's a skill that really lets
          you express yourself without having to say any words, with every strum
          and every note it unlocks a new part of your brain that can't be
          expressed but only felt.
