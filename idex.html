            I've been told that the intro to a website is like the welcome mat
            to your home, so I would like to take this time to thank you for
            visiting my website. As the name suggests this website is mainly all
            about my hobbies. Flying My Drone, Playing My Guitar, and Editing My
            family videos are some of my passions. As you scroll through my
            website you will be able to see how my hobbies have impacted my life
            and what they have meant to me. I also do hope you can enjoy the
            layout, color, and flow of my website as it did take a while to
            master a lot of these skills like Flexbox and Grid, while some I
            already knew about it was a fun and enjoyable journey to create this
            pleasantly appealing website. I would like to thank you for your
            time and I am always open to any feedback in the more section.
            please be kind as it is my first official website. Thank you!
          </p>

            <p>
              Dones have been a hobby of mine for as long as I can Remember,
              when I was a child I wanted to be a pilot when I grew up but it
              always seemed out of reach. Now with drones being more affordable
              than ever, I can finally get my wings, well at least in a virtual
              sense.

              Playing the Guitar is something I always recommend everyone learns
              to do, It is a skill that always impresses everyone at a campfire
              but to me, it's more than a cool party trick it's a skill that
              really lets you express yourself without having to say any words,
              with every strum and every note it unlocks a new part of your
              brain that can't be expressed but only felt.
